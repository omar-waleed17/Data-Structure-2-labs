# Data Structures 2 Labs

These are the labs for the **Data Structures 2** course at college, covering sorting algorithms, data structures, and graph algorithms.

## Lab 1 – O(n²) Sorting Algorithms

**Goal:** Understand different running times for sorting algorithms and compare best and worst-case performance.  

**Tasks:**  
- Implement **O(n²) sorting algorithms**:  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
- Generate random arrays of varying sizes (e.g., 1,000; 25,000; 50,000; 100,000).  
- Sort the same array with each algorithm and **measure the running time** in milliseconds.  

This lab demonstrates how the running time increases with array size and highlights the differences between O(n²) algorithms.

## Lab 2 – Advanced Sorting and K-th Smallest Element

**Part A:**  
- Implement efficient sorting algorithms: **Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort**.  
- Compare their performance on random arrays.  

**Part B:**  
- Implement a program that **finds the k-th smallest element** in an array using a modified Quickselect algorithm.  
- Sort an array of random integers using a **hybrid Merge Sort** that switches to Insertion Sort for small subarrays.  

This lab focuses on **efficient sorting techniques** and advanced array operations.

## Lab 3 – Dictionary Application with Red-Black Tree

**Description:**  
This code implements a **simple dictionary application**.  
- Uses a **Red-Black Tree** to efficiently store, look up, and insert words from a text file.  
- Ensures the tree remains **balanced** for optimal search and insertion performance.  
- Demonstrates practical use of **self-balancing binary search trees** in managing dynamic datasets.

## Lab 4 – Graph Algorithms: Topological Sort & Prim's Algorithm

**Description:**  
This code demonstrates two fundamental **graph algorithms**:  

- **Topological Sort:**  
  - Performs a topological sort on a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**, arranging nodes so that for every edge from node A to node B, A comes before B.  

- **Prim's Algorithm:**  
  - Applies Prim's algorithm to a **weighted undirected graph** to find its **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, connecting all nodes with the minimum total edge weight.  

This lab highlights the application of **graph traversal and optimization algorithms** in practical scenarios.
